## Introduction

### Scenario

Let us consider our current pandemic scenario:

We are all at home, inter-facing each others with a computer which is recording us.
Currently the microphones of your computer are hopefully capturing my sound.

We need to ignore the post-processing of the video-conference tools
In particular, they are recording

- the sound of my voice,
- some source of noise, such as the computer fan, transmission noise, the traffic outside, someone of my family in the other rooms, music that my brother is playing, the mobile phone, etc.

These are sound **sources**.
However, if you think about it, there is much more.
From the only audio, you may understand that:

- I am speaking close to the microphones, somehow in foreground with respect to the rest.
- The interfering sound source is far away and probably moving.
- We can understand if we are in a indoor or outdoor environment.

The microphones recording keep tracks of the environment where the sound are being recorded.

In natural environment, the sound propagates and interact with the environment.
The overall effect is well known and it called *reverberation*.
All these makes the audio scene we are immersed into.
