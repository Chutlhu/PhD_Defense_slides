## Introduction

<!-- Hello everyone -->
Hello everyone and thanks to be here.

### Scenario

In order to better introduce the topic of the thesis, let us consider this current **scenario**:

Currently the **microphones** of my laptop are hopefully recording

- the sound of my voice,
- some source of noise, such as the computer fan, transmission noise, the traffic outside, someone of my family in the other rooms, music that my brother is playing, the mobile phone, etc.

These are sound **sources**.
However, if you think about it, there is much more.
From the only audio, you may understand that:

- I am speaking close to the microphones, somehow in foreground with respect to the rest.
- The interfering sound source is far away and probably moving.
- We can understand if we are in a indoor or outdoor environment.

The microphones recording keep tracks of the environment where the sound are being recorded.

In natural environment, the sound propagates and interact with the environment.
The overall effect is well known and it called *reverberation*.
All these makes the audio scene we are immersed into and we assumed it is recorded by microphones.

The **audio scene** are all the element that describe.

### Audio Scene Analysis

We can broadly categorize the information as

- semantic information, about the source nature and its content
- spatial information, about source position and room geometry
- and temporal information, when someone is speaking

and we can recognize in this division some fundamental questions that we instinctively process and answer:

- *Who* is speaking, *What* is the content, *What* is the noise
- *Where* the speakers are located
- *When* the speaker is speaking and is not
- and *how* the sound is propagates and produced.

We leave the *Why* to other field of studies.

We will refer to the process of extracting and organizing such information for raw microphones recordings as
Audio Scene Analysis.

Human and animals are known to perform some of these task effortlessly,
such as be able to understand a conversation in crowdy bar or use acoustic echoes for orientation.
The role of our studies is to develop system that are able to do it as well.
You can think about smart speakers, robots, hearing aids and measurements techniques, better teleconferencing system.

### Signal Processing

Signal processing offers us mathematical models, frameworks and tools to address the problems we mentioned earlier.

For instance we can identify the following well-know problems,
each of ones is dedicated to address a specific natural question.

Most of them are well know open problem which produced large and vast literature.

It is really important to notice that all the problem are naturally interconnected.
The resolution of one of the above problem may be better if prior information is available.

### Echo aware approach

Audio Scene Analysis give us our problems we want to solve
Signal processing give us models and tools

You may ask then... what is the role of acoustic echoes?
Echoes give us useful information that can be used for better processing.

Acoustic echoes are elements of Sound Propagation.
Therefore their knowledge can be used to better inform inverse problems.
Their information gives an idea of the mixing filters.

Moreover we can also interpret them:

- As sound repetition: echoes brings sound information (example of beamforming??)
- As sound spatialization: they time of arrival (and direction of arrival) depends on the room geometry (example of rooge)

Accoring to the how the sound propagation is modeled in audio signal processing methods, we can device it is

  - on that completely ignore it
  - free-field models
  - multipath-models
  - reverberatan models


### Challenges and Objective

Current challenges:

- Turning enemies into friends
  - Anechoic (neglecting echoes) -> echoes are enemy
  - Reverberation (modeling the full RIRs) -> very challenging task
- estimating acoustic echoes in noisy environment is a non-trivial task
- how to use properly the information?

In this thesis we will see how to estimate the echoes and how to estimate them and how to integrate this

- model echoes in signal processing
- estimate echoes
- apply echoes
- data for validation

## Echo-aware Signal Models

In the following slides we will see how echoes are modeled in the context of room acoustics and consequently described in audio signal processing.

### Echoes and Signal Processing I

The complete sound propagation include all the interaction of the sound travelling in whole environment.
This processing including different types of interaction with surrounding surfaces and objects

- specular and diffuse reflections
- absorption
- diffraction, interferences and transmission

<!-- These effects occurs in different proportion based on the geometrical and physical properties of the objects in the space. -->

<!-- In particular when a sound reach a big smooth surface, part of it is **reflected specularly** and part of it is absorbed,
soft surfaces like wood or wool absorb more then hard surface, like concrete walls.
If the surface is rough then, part of the energy is *scattered* around in random directions.
Absorption, diffusion and specular reflection always occurs, but in different proportion, depending on the geometrical and physical properties of the surfaces and the frequency excited by the original source.
Other effects exists, such as diffraction and transmission are here neglected. -->


From a signal processing point of view the sound recorded at any microphone can be generalized to any sound source as input-filter-output process:

- the input is the sound source signal
- the filter accounts for the whole sound propagation and it can be described with the so-called acoustic impulse response (AIR), which is the signal corresponding to the propagation of a perfect impulsive sound.
- the output is the sound recorded at the microphones

If we record the sound field of a single omnidirectional point source emitting an impulse sound, at
the microphones we will records something like:

In math, the sound at the microphone can be modeled as the convolution between the source and the filter.

In general AIR and acoustic filters are very complicated.
However for simple indoor environments, such as office, meeting room and classroom, some key elements can be recognized:

- a direct path which accounts for the time the sound takes to travel from the source position to the microphones position
- a few distinct early reflection which can be modeled with the specular low
- reverberation due to the continuous bouncing of reflection

For this peculiar shapes, there referred to as room impulse response, aka RIR.

According to how the sound propagation is modeled, we can define different audio signal processing approaches:

The early reflection are what we consider as echoes, since they can characterized by a particular prominence and time sparsity.

### Echoes and Signal Processing II


<!-- ### Echoes and Signal Processing II

In light of the signal processing theory, this process can be modeled with the typical source-filter-receiver model, where the relation between input and output is express with the following convolution.

$$ x_{ij} = (h_{ij} \ast s_j)(t) $$

In other words, microphone $i$ listens to the convolution between the signal of source $j$ and a filter which, in case of room acoustics, accounts for the full propagation of the sound in the room.

From the physics, we know that this phenomenon is

- time invariant in static scenario,
- and linear. Therefore it is easy to generalize to multiple microphones and sources.

Room Impulse Responses are complicated and long filters that  collects all the element of indoor reverberation and sound interaction with the environments.

However, they a common shape can be identified and illustrated as function of time.

- First there is the so-called direct path, with describe the time and amplitude of the sound reaching the receiver.
- Second, in order of time we have the early echoes, which are repetition of

### Physics to Signal Processing

Sound is emitted by a sound **source**, propagates and interact with the surrounding the **indoor spaces** and is recorded by a **receiver**, such as a microphones.

In particular, the sound can be absorbed, reflected specularly and diffusely and diffracted.

If we imagine to produce an impulse sound, such as a clap or a gun shot. In the recording of the sound we will observe first the sound itself, called the direct path. Then some reflection will arrive and finally all the reflection will accumulate.

In light of signal processing and communication theory, we can model this process as a **input-channel-output system**. The channel is characterized by the so-called **impulse response** and the relation between input and output is express mathematically by the convolution operator. Therefore in our context, this is called **room impulse response**, $h$.

Several element can be identified in the **RIR**.

- the direct path is the line-of-sight contribution of the sound wave.
- the early echoes comprise few disjoint specular reflection coming from room surface. They are typically characterized by **sparsity** in the time and amplitude prominence greater than the later contributions.
- the late reverberation collects all the later reflection.

Note that if we assume the **anechoic** condition...
**Continuous echo model here**

*Transition How do we model this in computer? This quantities are continuous....*

### Signal Processing to Digital signal processing

The **RIR** account for the filtering effect due to sound propagation from a source to a microphone in a indoor space:

$$\tilde{x}(t) = (\tilde{h} \ast \tilde{s})(t) $$
$$h(t) = \sum_k^K \delta{t - \tau_k}$$

Unfortunately, these quantities are not accessible as they are continuous.

Through the use of microphones, our window into the continuous physical world of acoustics is narrow, both it time and in frequency.

In particular what we **observe** is the sampling version of $x(t)$, namely $x[n]$ where $n$ is a integer multiple of the sampling frequency

Here, we decide to model this as the linear convolution between the digital version of the filter $h[n]$ and the digital version of the source signal $s[n]$. Not that this is general is not true and some approximation are made. -->

### Echo Model

Finally we will use the following model.

Type of noise

- interference
- measurement error
- diffuse noise sources

### 1 Interim Conclusion

- RIRs are the signal processing of the sound propagation
- Mic recordings = Convolution between RIRs and Source
- Echoes are repetition of sounds
- Echoes can be seen in the RIR
- RIR as ISM
- Echoes are off grid -> echo model in the frequency domain

## Echo Estimation / Retrieval

### Intro on acoustic echo estimation

First we need to estimate the echoes properties, we identify as the time of arrival and the strength of a sound reflection.
We will refer to is as **Acoustic Echo Retrieval**.

The problem of identifying only the arrival time is typically known as Time of Arrival, aka TOA estimation.


In the literature we can identify many way to address this problems.

At first, we can can broadly classify existing method based on the availability of the **transmitted signals**.
If the reference signal is know then it is the case of **active**

### 3 Interim Conclusion

## Echo-aware dataset

All the methodologies presented so far where evaluated on synthetic data.
This is a common procedure in many audio signal processing research.

- collecting and annotating exhaustive data covering many application is tedious task
- (echo-aware methods) annotation of early echoes require expertise and equipment
- (learning methods) lot of data and acoustic scenario
- (acoustic simulators) acoustic simulators can reach a good level of approximation (some applications)
  - SSL
  - ASR (\cite{Google})

For all these reasons, many works are validated on simulated data.
Nevertheless real data are necessary to validate the approaches and many RIRs databases are available online.

We can divide them broadly in two groups:

- Speech Enhancements oriented databases. They require:
  - different relative DOAs, many sources
  - different level of SNR, RT60, DRR
  - array geometry
  - $\Rightarrow$ the contains strong echoes, but are not annotated, nor the room geometry
- Room Geometry Estimation oriented databases
  - geometrical annotation of src, mic, room
  - different room shapes
  - the signal annotation is partially available (need to be computed a posteriori by the user)
  - $\Rightarrow$ the contains strong echoes, but no multichannel arrays, nor multiple speaker or various RT60

### Recording & Annotation

A good echo-aware methods needs

- good geometrical annotation as well as good signal annotation.
  This two should match
- designed to be used for
  - echo estimation (need for peak annotation)
  - echo-aware signal application (source separation, speech enhancement)
  - echo-aware geometry application (source localization, microphones calibration, room geometry estimation)

The dEchorate database was created to meet this requirements.
It has the following characteristics:
Moreover it has

- many acoustic environment (one-hotted and incremental and fornitures)
- 6 linear array and 4 sources
- position of source and first order image sources annotated and echo annotated
- Code to get real RIRs and *matching* simulated RIRs

Further possibility

- Do some learning due to the quantities of RIRs (>)
- Study the difference between synth and real RIRs

### Annotation

The annotation was done using the following tools:

- The exact knowledge planimetry of the room
- RIR estimation with ESS (Farinas) and a calibrated acquisition system
- and Indoor Positioning System for an initial guess
- Echo annotatation with a GUI visualizing echoes
  - Skyline
  - Manual peak peaking
  - Matched filter (Equalization)
- Exact multilateration algorithm for refinement the position

Limitation

- the exact annotation of the echoes is challenging due to the non ideal loudspeaker
- only nULA
- only first order images (= first k echoes) --- the sometimes the second strongest echoes comes from the ceiling

Learn from my mistakes:

- put a microphone close to the source, always.
- check the loudspeaker characteristics
- etc...

### Validation

In order to validate the dataset and show its potential we considered to following application:

- Acoustic Echo Estimation
  - task: estimate the echoes
  - test against simulated and real RIRs
- Room Geometry Estimation
  - task: estimate the room geometry from knowing echoes
- Echo-aware Speech Enhancement using beamforming
  - task: multichannel denoising and dereverberation
  - test echo-aware vs. echo-agnostic bf
  - test against simulated and real RIRs

#### Room Geometry Estimation

In a nutshell, Room Geometry Estimation can be done from TOAs annotation (label and value)

1. identifying the position of the image source with multilateration (3D extention of trilateration)
    Convex and closed-from, but ill-conditioned by noise. Beck can do that
2. by simply computing the plane that bisects the segments between the source and its image
  this methods is called Images Source Inversion

Many other methods for Room Geometry Estimation exists, they differs based on the knowledge of the labels and the setup.

We can see here an examples of the estimation

If we run this method for all the microphones of one room configuration we obtain the following results:
